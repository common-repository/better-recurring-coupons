Enables the ability to use standard WooCommerce fixed-product and percent coupons with recurring WooCommerce subscriptions.

== Description ==

If you have a WooCommerce store that has a mix of products and subscription offerings, you may have noticed the frustration of providing coupons and discounts and to your customers.

Historically, you would need to create 2 different coupons each for products and for subscriptions. Customers would then need to apply multiple coupons to their cart in order for discounts to be applied to the initial cart total as well as recurring cart totals.

But no more!

Better Recurring Coupons allows you to use a single standard coupon for both normal products and subscriptions.

= Features =
* A single default coupon can be applied to both normal WooCommerce products and WooCommerce subscriptions
* Uses standard WooCommerce coupons â€“ No custom coupon types which promotes compatibility with other coupon-enhancing plugins or affiliate plugins
* Drop-in and easy to use. No code or configurations!


= How to use =
- Go to the WooCommerce Coupons menu in the WordPress admin dashboard. Add or edit a Coupon
- Select one of **Percentage discount** or **Fixed product discount**
- Check the option **Allow Subscriptions**

== Installation ==

Upload the Better Recurring Coupon plugin to your blog, activate it.

1, 2, 3: You're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can multiple coupon codes be used at checkout? =

No. At this time, the plugin only allows one coupon to be used at a time. The most recently submitted valid coupon is the one that will be applied to the cart contents and recurring charges.

= What coupon types are supported? =

"Fixed Product" and "Percent" coupons can be converted to be support discounts for subscription in addition to default simple/variable products.

"Fixed Cart" coupons conflict with the concept of having a recurring and ongoing discount and so is not supported.

= Can I limit how many recurring payments a coupon is applied to? =

This version will enable a standard coupon to be used for the duration of a subscription. The Pro version offers an option to limit the discount to "X" payments (similar to subscription coupon functionality)
